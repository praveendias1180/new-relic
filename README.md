# O11y
## Ollie - So "O11Y", if you're really cool, you call it Ollie

> "But "O11Y" if you've queued into this standard, you take a long word, take the first letter, the last letter, and then you count the characters in between. There's your industry term."

> "Because you know what, Praveen, I always miss the V. Every time I type observability. I always miss the V. So O11Y or Oliie, I will never miss a V."

# Monitoring and Ollie

https://www.logicmonitor.com/blog/monitoring-and-o11y-why-you-need-both

- Monitoring alerts when something is wrong, while observability endeavors to understand why.
- The data from the monitoring stack forms a basis of observability.
- Therefore, observability is impossible without some level of monitoring.
- Observability is a practice, while monitoring is driven by technology
- Monitoring only tells you that a problem happened. Ideally, observability tells you what caused that problem.
- Observability identifies unknowns, while monitoring aims at reporting known errors

> "Metrics tell you whether you have a problem, but they don’t tell you the root cause. Common examples would be: a CPU at 100%, a disk that’s full, or a network link that’s dropping packets."

- Observability is more about the relationship between data than the data itself.
- Rather than merely logging numbers, observability helps determine the app’s health by providing insights into the applications’ future performance.
- Observability is a fundamental property of an application and its supporting infrastructure.
