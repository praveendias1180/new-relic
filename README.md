# O11y
## Ollie - So "O11Y", if you're really cool, you call it Ollie

> "But "O11Y" if you've queued into this standard, you take a long word, take the first letter, the last letter, and then you count the characters in between. There's your industry term."

> "Because you know what, Praveen, I always miss the V. Every time I type observability. I always miss the V. So O11Y or Oliie, I will never miss a V."
